# crystal-collector-game

### Description
It is a web game where it starts by displaying a random number and four crystals each have a hidden random number. When a player clicks on a crystal it adds its mumber to the player's result. The player has to guess which crystals to click on to reach the displayed random number.


### Game Logic
- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
- The game will hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
- The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. - Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
